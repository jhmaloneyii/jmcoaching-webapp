        <h3>But where do you begin?</h3>
        <p>Getting started can be the hardest part. How do we plan? What goals are reasonable? How do we know we’re improving? There can be a lot of uncertainty when it comes to training. Don’t let it slow you down or overwhelm you. Have a clear direction and confidence in your training program. Save money and time by using intelligent and proven training techniques.</p>

            <h3>Plan</h3>
            <p>Training is a commitment because performance takes time to develop. To effectively train a good plan is essential because it keeps the focus on the long term development and puts the short term challenges and successes in perspective. A good plan is build around an understanding of the athlete, their background, their goals, and their time. For these reasons, all JM Coaching athletes have the option to put a longer term plan in place.</p>

            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>There is no shortcut, no magic. To get faster you have to put the work in. But with JM Coaching, you’re not alone. Athletes get workout analysis, discussion, and feedback on workout execution. All this helps you hone your skill as an athlete and improve the way you train and race. With open lines of communication, JM Coaching is there to make sure the work is worth it.</p>

            <h3>Analyze</h3>
            <p>There is more to training than just working out. Every athlete responds differently to training and what sets a great athlete apart from the rest is what they learn. JM Coaching tracks dozens of metrics both long and short term to understand how you respond to training and to fine tune the workouts. This is called closed loop training. Closed training is responsive to you and your life, it learns and improves over time, and changes with you.</p>
